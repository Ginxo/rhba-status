# Project Status Web Page

This package contains the source code of React web application. The web application has to be instantiated by your own configuration like information page markdown file. 
The data consumed by the app is preprocessed by [action package](https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/tree/main/packages/action) so no need for a backend and can be easily published on services like Github Packages.

The look and feel of this web application mainly relies on the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) React library, which provides a set of high quality components for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

## Local Development

If you want to build or contribute to this project you will probably need to build/run this web application locally, here few steps to follow:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kiegroup/chain-status.git
```

2. Install all libraries [run it in the project's root]
```bash
$ yarn
```

3. Run the application in development mode [run it in the `webpage` package]
```bash
$ yarn run
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Keep in mind that the page will reload if you make edits on the source code.

4. Build the whole project [run it on the project's root]
```bash
$ yarn build
```

## Installation

If you want to install this web application on your repository in an automated way, this project comes with an easy to use [Github action](https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/blob/main/.ci/actions/generate-app/action.yml) that you can use on your Github workflows.


The **generate-app** action is in charge to checkout this project, build it using `yarn` and publish it on a specific branch of the repository is including it.

### Action Steps
Here the main important steps performed by **generate-app** action:

1. Checkout in the branch where you want to store the webpage code and content, the default is `gh-pages`. [the first time you run this action there will be no webpage]
2. Checkout in the original [chain-status](https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status) repository, i.e., this one.
3. Setup nodejs and build the webpage using `yarn`.
4. Check if in the target branch (e.g., `gh-pages`) there are old content/configuration files by checking the `data/` folder. If there exists, it copies its content under the newly compiled webpage (under `./packages/webpage/public/`).
5. Deploy the created page using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) tool in the target branch (e.g., `gh-pages`).

## Technical Information

### Lazy loading

1. I use redux to handle states. sectionsShow specifically https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/blob/main/packages/webpage/src/service/layout.service.tsx#L43

2. Then section is only shown based on the state https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/blob/f891b11cfedfc8c10143a2c7f7c1d0afd5a7bc0f/packages/webpage/src/components/pullrequests/List.tsx#L21

3. and then the section is registered  on redux machinery based on the callback from https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/blob/f891b11cfedfc8c10143a2c7f7c1d0afd5a7bc0f/packages/webpage/src/components/shared/MenuSelection.tsx#L29 whenever the section is shown based on an observer with some extra margins https://github.com/kiegroup/chain-status/blob/4ac20d86fcec9d6f94879bef6f3ad614527b03a2/packages/webpage/src/components/shared/MenuSelection.tsx#L86
